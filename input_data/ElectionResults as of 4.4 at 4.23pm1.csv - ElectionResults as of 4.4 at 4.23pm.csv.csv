SubmissionId,"In last year’s election,the student body approved the Constitutional Clarity & Consistency Amendment 2015 to resolve current loopholes and inconsistencies in the ASUC Constitution,bring up to date the foundational document of the ASUC,simplify the document to be more accessible to students and leaders,and allow the ASUC to function more efficiently and equitably for long­term success. This amendment makes further technical changes to the Constitution to accomplish these goals. The language of the amendment,including footnotes describing the rationale for each change,is provided in the Elections Information Guide. Do you approve the ratification of the Constitutional Clarity & Consistency Amendment 2016?",Proposition A: Constitutional Clarity & Consistency Amendment 2016,"The Ink Initiative Fee,a $2.50 per semester fee assessed to all students in the spring and fall semesters,would provide The Daily Californian,Berkeley’s independent newspaper,with the financial support necessary to (1) continue printing and distributing free newspapers across the campus and surrounding areas and (2) expand its online capacities (3) maintain itself as a training ground for UC Berkeley students in reporting,graphic and web design,and business operations. The Ink Initiative,subject to an annual inflation adjustment based on the San Francisco Area Consumer Price Index,would last for five years — beginning in fall 2017 and ending in spring 2022 — with 33 percent returning to financial aid for all students. It would not apply to students during the Summer Session.
